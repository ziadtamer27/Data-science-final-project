# Stroke Risk Prediction - Healthcare Predictive Analytics 

This project is part of the IBM AI & Data Science Track , focused on developing a predictive model to assess stroke risk based on various health parameters. The system provides healthcare professionals with data-driven insights for patient risk prediction and informed decision-making.

## Project Overview

The Healthcare Predictive Analytics project uses machine learning to forecast stroke risk, helping healthcare providers identify patients who may benefit from preventive interventions. The project follows a structured approach through multiple milestones:

1. **Data Collection, Exploration, and Preprocessing**
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**
3. **Predictive Model Development and Optimization**
4. **MLOps, Deployment, and Monitoring**
5. **Final Documentation and Presentation**

## Data Description

The dataset contains various health parameters that can influence stroke risk:

- **age**: Patient's age
- **gender**: Patient's gender (Male/Female)
- **hypertension**: Whether the patient has hypertension (0/1)
- **heart_disease**: Whether the patient has heart disease (0/1)
- **ever_married**: Marriage status (Yes/No)
- **work_type**: Type of employment (Private, Self-employed, Govt_job, Children, Never_worked)
- **Residence_type**: Living environment (Urban/Rural)
- **avg_glucose_level**: Average glucose level in blood
- **bmi**: Body Mass Index
- **smoking_status**: Smoking habits (never smoked, formerly smoked, smokes)
- **stroke**: Target variable - whether the patient had a stroke (1) or not (0)

## Key Features

- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Comprehensive analysis of health metrics and their relationships
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of categorical features from continuous variables
- **Model Selection**: Comparison of multiple ML algorithms (XGBoost selected as final model)
- **Web Application**: FastAPI-based interface for healthcare professionals to input patient data
- **Risk Assessment**: Immediate prediction of stroke risk with probability percentage
